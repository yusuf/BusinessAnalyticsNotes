## Data story telling

By 2022, 90% of corporate strategies will explicitly mention information as a critical enterprise asset and analytics as an essential competency.

Data and analytics will become the centerpiece of enterprise strategy, focus and investment

*   **Collect and socialize** examples of the internal and external economic benefits from data and analytics that your organization (or other similar organizations or industries) has generated.
    
*   **Offer or insist** on being involved in corporate strategic planning to ensure that data and analytics competencies are incorporated, if not already featured, within these plans. Communicate this information internally and publicly in annual reports, investor conferences, etc.
    
*   **Measure and communicate** the value of the organizationâ€™s information assets to help shift the culture into believing and behaving as if information is an actual asset.
    
*   **Build, buy and borrow** advanced analytics competencies (such as data science or machine learning) beyond traditional business intelligence and embed them throughout the business.
