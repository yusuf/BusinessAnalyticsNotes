#### Dave Holtz, data scientist at Airbnb
A Data Scientist is a Data Analyst who lives in San Francisco?

Some companies/fields/programs anyone is a data scientist, regardless of what they do!

#### Everyone has their own definitions

##### S. Kakati
Data science, also known as data-driven science, is an interdisciplinary field about scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, similar to data mining

##### J.L Heilbron
Data science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions

##### J. Leek
The key word in data science is not "data" it is "science". Data science is only useful when the data are used to answer a question. That is the science part of the equation

#### History of the term
- The term data science -> 1974
- Danish computer user Peter Naur urged for a potentially different name for engineering science
- Data Science was originally used interchangeably with Computer Science
- When Harvard BR called it the Sexist Job of the 21st Century, the term became a buzzword
- Now it is often applied to business analytics, or even an arbitrary use of data
- CF Jeff Wu, 1997, Statistics = Data Science
	- data collection, data modelling and analysis and decision making
	- In his conclusion, he initiated the modern, non computer science, usage of the term, "data science" and advocated that statistics be renamed data science and statisticians - data scientists
- William S. Cleveland, 2001, Data Science : An Action Plan to Expand the Technical Field of Statistics
	- William is credited with conception of data science, as a separate discipline, extending the field of statistics to incorporate advances in computing with data

#### William established 6 technical areas which he believed to encompass the field of data science
1. multidisciplinary investigations
2. models and methods for data
3. computing with data
4. pedagogy
5. tool evaluation
6. and theory

- 1,000s of years ago we used abacus
- 500s years ago, we used mechanical calculating machines (Wilhelm Schickard, 1623)
- 100s of years ago, we used Dalton's adding-listing machine (1902)
- Today we use computers. But we are still trying to do the same thing, generate meaning out of data.

### Contents
- Foundational course for graduate education in data analytics
	- review course, state-of-the-art interdisciplinary data analysis methods
	- introduce problem formulation at the intersection of mathematics and social science
	- gateway to advanced graduate studies (phd) in different fields

#### Master's program "Network Analytics for Business"
- Core : 6 general lectures & 6 specific topics reviewed in details
- Specialization : 6 overview lectures of the classical "path to insights" methods
- From descriptive to prescriptive analytics
- For practicing analysts, discussion and examples focus on applications in business and management

#### Course Structure
- Value vs Difficulty
	- What happened? (Descriptive Analytics)
		- **Information** -> Hindsight
	- Why did it happen? (Inferential Analytics)
		- Decision-making -> Insight
	- What will happen? (Predictive Analytics)
		- Optimization -> **Foresight**
	- How can we make it happen? (Prescriptive Analytics)

##### Data Issues
